# MODELS

### In Django, models are Python classes that represent the structure of your database tables. They define the fields (columns) and relationships between different tables. By defining models, you essentially create a blueprint for your database.

When you have created a model u have to apply this changes into django with migrations

Migrations are a powerful tool in Django that allows you to manage changes to your database schema. They track modifications made to your models and automatically generate the necessary SQL statements to apply those changes to your database.

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigration
```
+ Purpose: This command looks at the models.py file in your Django apps and detects any changes(like new models or changes to existing models). It generates a migration file that contains instructions for applying those changes to your database.
+ Output: It creates a migration file in the migrations directory of your app (e.g., 0001_initial.py for the first migration).
+ Required: Yes, this is necessary for Django to understand what changes need to be applied to the database.

```bash
python3 manage.py sqlmigrate news 0001
python3 manage.py sqlmigrate <app_name> <migration_number>
```
+ Purpose: This command takes a specific migration file (e.g., 0001) and shows the raw SQL that Django will execute when applying the migration to the database.
+ Example: python3 manage.py sqlmigrate news 0001 will show the SQL that corresponds to the migration file 0001 for the news app.
+ Importance:
This command is optional. It's primarily for debugging or learning purposes to understand what SQL will be executed.
You do not need to run this to apply migrations to your database.
+ When to use: If you're curious or want to ensure the migration is doing what you expect before running it.

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```
+ Purpose: This command actually applies the migrations to your database. It executes the SQL commands defined in the migration files (generated by makemigrations).
+ Required: Yes, this is essential to apply changes to the database and ensure your project is in sync with the models.
